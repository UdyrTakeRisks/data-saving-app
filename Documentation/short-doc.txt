Short Documentation

Experience:

 - Learned more about fastapi as it was on my frameworks study list, implemented robust apis with data validation and integrated with sqlite database, i also learned alot about it while developing this application.
 
 - Practiced more on docker and how to leverage the use of containers and how far it facilitates running the environments we work on.
 
 - Worked more on bash scripts and how automation can give us more time in development new features instead of writing repetitive commands.

 - Gained valuable experience in integrating frontend with backend specifically with the native form action and method.

 - Tried to work under short time to sumbit the task within the deadline and in the same time showed off my skills in completing the task objectives and deliverables.
 
 - Applied error handling mechanisms using try-except and HTTPException class.
 
 

Challenges:

 - Integrating the native html form with the backend api without using javascript fetch function or using frontend frameworks like axios function in React.js for example

 - Opening index.html and serving static files like images to be rendered from the fastapi root endpoint.
 
 - Handling api response to be rendered on the web browser.
 
 - Making a customized docker image for both fastapi and sqlite.
 
 - Facing some issues in writing sqlite commands in a bash script to ease testing for the stored data. 
 
 
 
Future Work:

 - API Authentication
 
 - Server logging
 
 - API response rendering in html
